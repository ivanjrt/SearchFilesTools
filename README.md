# SearchFilesTools

**Tool Objective:** 🧐 To search a specific keyword within log files such (Log, Txt, Reg, Html, Json, Xml)<br/>
As this app is going trough the files, it will convert evtx files to xml for better handling <br/>
ps. (_Going after EVTX files directly make things very complicated logically and some features non-feasable_)<br/>
